## Overview

`arp_spoofer.py` is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) tool that performs **ARP cache poisoning** to intercept traffic between targets and the gateway on a local network. Unlike a basic ARP spoofer, this script is built to **run for extended periods**, **adapt to network changes** automatically, and **handle massive target lists without crashing**.

It was designed primarily for **Windows** and includes:

- Per-adapter network detection (WiFi / Ethernet)
- Manual configuration mode
- Internet connectivity monitoring and auto-recovery
- WiFi reconnect and captive portal handling
- Live DNS, HTTP logging, and PCAP capture
- Standalone network and WiFi scanning with export
- L2 raw socket injection for zero-CPU overhead
- Unkillable wrapper and global `Ctrl+C` handling

## Operation Modes

### 1. ARP Attack Mode (default)

The main mode. Poisons ARP tables to position your machine between targets and the gateway.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py -a -s
```

### 2. Device Scan Mode (`--scan`)

Performs an ARP scan, displays a table of IP / MAC / hostname, then exits.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --scan
python arp_spoofer.py --scan -o devices.json
```

### 3. WiFi Scan Mode (`--scan-wifi`)

Scans nearby WiFi networks using the Windows WLAN API, displays SSID / BSSID / signal / auth, then exits.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --scan-wifi
python arp_spoofer.py --scan-wifi -o wifi.json
```

---

## Network Configuration

The script supports three ways to configure the network:

### Auto-detect (default)

When `-r` and `-g` are not provided and `--manual` is not set:

1. Lists all active network adapters via PowerShell (`Get-NetAdapter`, `Get-NetIPAddress`, `Get-NetRoute`)
2. Filters out virtual adapters (VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, VPN, etc.)
3. Selects the **best adapter** (prioritizes adapters with a valid IP + gateway)
4. Derives the subnet (actual prefix or `/24`) and gateway from that adapter
5. Configures Scapy to use the matching capture interface

### Manual mode (`--manual`)

Disables all auto-detection. You must provide the network range and gateway yourself.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --manual -r 192.168.1.0/24 -g 192.168.1.1 -a -s
```

If `-r` or `-g` are missing, the script prompts you interactively.

> **Tip:** Combine with `-i` to also select which adapter Scapy uses for packet capture.

### Adapter selection (`-i`)

Lists all available adapters in a table:

```
+----+----------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+
| #  | Name                 | Type         | IP             | Gateway        | Status       |
+----+----------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+
| 1  | Wi-Fi                | WiFi         | 192.168.1.42   | 192.168.1.1    | Up           |
| 2  | Ethernet             | Ethernet     | 10.0.0.5       | 10.0.0.1       | Up           |
+----+----------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+
```

```bash
# Interactive selection
python arp_spoofer.py -i -a -s

# Direct selection (adapter #2)
python arp_spoofer.py -i 2 -a -s
```

The selected adapter determines:
- Scapy capture interface
- IP address and gateway used for auto-detect
- WiFi profile context for recovery

---

## ARP Attack

### How it works

For each target, the script sends spoofed ARP replies:

1. **To the target:** "The gateway IP is at **my MAC address**"
2. **To the gateway:** "The target IP is at **my MAC address**"

Traffic flows through your machine, enabling interception and sniffing.

### Performance Engine

- **L2Socket Injection:** Instead of opening and closing a raw socket for every packet (`scapy.sendp`), the script opens a persistent `scapy.L2socket`. Packets are injected directly to the network card, reducing CPU usage to near zero.
- **Packet Caching:** ARP packets are built once and stored in an internal cache. The spoofing loop merely iterates over pre-built bytes, only rebuilding the cache if a target MAC changes.

### Target selection

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Default** | ARP scan → display device table → you pick one IP |
| **`-a` (auto)** | Silently scans and attacks all devices except the gateway and whitelist |
| **`-t` (direct)** | Bypasses scanning, directly attacks the specified IP |

### Live status bar

During the attack, a real-time status line is displayed. ANSI line-clearing ensures DNS/WEB logs don't fragment the status bar:

```
Packets: 126 | Targets: 21 | Internet: ONLINE | Uptime: 00:15:33 | Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Clean exit & Unkillable Wrapper

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. A global `sys.excepthook` intercepts the interrupt, stops all background threads instantly using `Event.wait()`, and sends restoration ARP packets to restore normal network operation.

If a fatal error occurs, the script catches it, logs the traceback, and prompts: `Do you want to restart the script? (y/N)`.

### Background maintenance

| Task | Interval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Watchdog | 30s | Checks gateway, internet, triggers recovery |
| Target refresh | 1 min | Detects new devices (auto-attack mode) |
| MAC refresh | 1.15 min | Re-resolves ARP for all targets |
| Spoof failure recovery | Per cycle | Re-fetches MAC after 5 consecutive failures |

---

## Traffic Sniffing

Enable with `-s` or `--pcap`. The sniffer runs in a non-blocking background thread (1-second burst sniffing) and logs:

### DNS Log

Captures **DNS queries only** (not responses). Filters out empty or invalid names.

```
[DNS LOG] www.google.com
[DNS LOG] _bose-passport._tcp.local
```

Filtering rules:
- Only DNS requests (`qr == 0`)
- Skips empty, root, or invalid domain names
- Strips trailing dots and non-printable characters

### WEB Log

Captures HTTP requests (unencrypted):

```
[WEB LOG] example.com/path/to/page
```

### PCAP Capture (`--pcap`)

Save all raw traffic to a file for offline analysis (e.g., Wireshark). Uses `scapy.PcapWriter` in synchronous mode to write to disk without consuming RAM.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py -a -s --pcap capture.pcap
```

---

## Network Resilience Engine

The `NetworkResilience` class monitors connectivity and recovers automatically when the network drops or your IP gets blacklisted.

### Internet detection

Checks connectivity using:
- TCP probes to public DNS servers (`8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`, `208.67.222.222`)
- HTTP probes to standard connectivity check URLs (Google, Microsoft, Apple)

Results are cached for **15 seconds** to reduce overhead.

### Recovery pipeline

When internet or gateway is lost, the following methods are tried in order:

| Step | Method | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **DHCP Renew** | Reset to DHCP, release/renew IP, flush DNS |
| 2 | **Local IP Change** | Assign a random static IP in the current subnet |
| 3 | **MAC Rotation** | Randomize adapter MAC via Windows registry |
| 4 | **Adapter Reset** | Disable and re-enable the network interface |
| 5 | **WiFi Reconnect** | Reconnect to the original WiFi using saved credentials |
| 6 | **WiFi Scan & Connect** | Scan nearby networks and connect to the best match |

A **120-second cooldown** prevents aggressive recovery loops.

### Captive portal handling

For public WiFi networks, the script attempts to auto-accept terms through:
1. HTML form submission (accept/agree/connect buttons)
2. Link clicking on portal pages
3. Fallback POST requests to common portal paths

### Recovery flow

```
Internet / Gateway lost
        |
        v
[Cooldown check - 120s minimum]
        |
        v
1. DHCP release / renew
        |-- fail
        v
2. Change local IP (random host in subnet)
        |-- fail
        v
3. Rotate MAC address
        |-- fail
        v
4. Reset network adapter
        |-- fail
        v
5. Reconnect to original WiFi
        |-- fail
        v
6. Scan WiFi and connect to best candidate
        |
        v
[Captive portal check and auto-accept]
        |
        v
Resume spoofing
```

Disable recovery with `--no-recovery`.

## WiFi Management

### Profile capture at startup

When connected via WiFi, the script saves:
- SSID, interface name, authentication type
- Password (from Windows stored profile via `netsh wlan show profile key=clear`)

### Smart WiFi reconnect

When scanning for alternative networks, candidates are ranked by:

1. Exact SSID match with the original network
2. Similar SSID (partial name match)
3. Same BSSID OUI (same router/AP vendor prefix)
4. Open networks
5. Signal strength

For secured networks, the saved WiFi password is reused. For open networks, a Windows WLAN profile is created automatically.

Supported authentication: **Open**, **WPA/WPA2-PSK**, **WPA3-SAE**.

### Native WiFi scanner

`--scan-wifi` uses the Windows `wlanapi.dll` API for live radio scanning:
- Triggers `WlanScan` on each active adapter
- Reads BSS list and available network list
- Falls back to `netsh wlan show networks` if the API returns no results

---

## Scanning

### Device scan (`--scan`)

Sends ARP requests across the subnet and resolves hostnames.

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --scan -o devices.json   # JSON export
python arp_spoofer.py --scan -o devices.csv    # CSV export
```

### WiFi scan (`--scan-wifi`)

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --scan-wifi -o wifi.json
```

---

## Session Logging

All events are logged automatically to:

```
logs/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

Custom path with `--log`:

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py -a -s --log my_session.log
```

**Log format:**

```
[2026-07-11 14:30:01] [INFO] Session started
[2026-07-11 14:30:02] [INFO] Auto-selected adapter: Wi-Fi (WiFi)
